<div class="q1"><h1>What is Pair Programming?</h1> 
<p> Pair programming is when two programmers collaborate on one task side by side. One assumes the role of a navigator while the other is the driver.  Pair programming allows both collaborators to focus on one role at a time, which helps to reduce errors and to write cleaner code.  </p>
</div>

<div class="q2"><h1>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h1> 
<p> Pair programming is important to DBC because it builds a sense of teamwork and establishes an environment that fosters effective communication. It is a standard means of programming in most companies today, which is why it is critical to be effective when working with others. </p>
</div>

<div class="q3"><h1>Compare Driver and Navigator.</h1> 
<p> The driver is responsible for typing the actual code while the navigator guides the driver, keeping in mind the bigger picture. The Navigator decides when to deviate from the original course and makes sure to get feedback from the driver before actually giving further instruction.

<div class="reflection"><h1>William's Reflection</h1> 
<p> 
     Pairing with a guide gives us a sense of what we should expect from of our work. Our guide kept us on track and even gave us pointers as to how to design a grid based website. After our guide left, my partner and I finished up the rest of the website and completed the GPS challenge. Good experience!
