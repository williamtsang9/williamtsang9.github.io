        <h3 style="text-align:left"><em>How did I feel about pairing?</em></h3><br>
       <h4 style="text-indent:40px"> I've read all of the feedback that my pairmates have given me. The reviews given about my performance and role as a pair has given me more insight on how to improve myself and my character. For example, I did not display role model traits as I did not know what to expect in terms of pairing. Thus my peers gave me feedback on how to improve in those aspects. My next few pairing sessions got better and better so I felt I made a significant improvement. This was also the same case for my initial feedback that I had left my pairmates. The first few were less informative and not exactly A.S.K. As I grew as a person and team player, I began giving more and more actionable, specific and kind reviews. I felt quite proud of this as I was never really good at telling people what and what they don't need to work on. </h4>

       <h4 style="text-indent:40px">I feel that feedback and reviews that aren't actionable, specific and kind are actually not beneficial at all. Those types of reviews do not benefit the peer as it doesn't target anything specific to work on. It doesn't provide a general guideline as to what is expected of them. It also shows that the reviewer did not spend the time to really analyze their partner's situation. Taking the time to really know what your peer needs to improve on really shows that you care about growth of your partner. It also helps you grow into a team player kind of person.
