I think that's the wrong way to look at it. My take on my DBC experience will be based on how bad I want to learn and what I want to make of it. The teachers are there to assist and guide us in the right directions but at the end of the day, it's the student that will decide if they want to learn it and succeed. My impression of DBC is that it has gone through multiple iterations of refinement. After each passing cohort graduation, the program is refined even finer and sharper than the previous curiculum. This is because the company wants to see you succeed, to be the better than we were yesterday. I usually stay away from the spotlight but I'm looking to change that. I'm looking to break pass my physical and mental barriers. I see myself melding into the culture just fine. There will definitely be people way ahead in the class and people behind trying to grasp the concepts. However, as a cohort, we all want to get through these challenges and make the most of our time here. If I find myself ahead of the group, I'd take a breather and give back to the group by helping those who need assistance. If the siutation were reversed, I'd want someone to give me a bit of a nudge in the right direction. That way, our caravan reaches the destination as a team! I knew from the moment that I applied to DBC, things would be up to me. It's up to me to make the decision to learn. DBC can only do so much to guide me in the right direction. I really intend to give it my all during my time here. I'm definitely excited to participate in this learning environment. It's definitely a first. People say they've been through bootcamps. Well, I can say I've been through a coding bootcamp once I succeed at DBC. I am nervous in a way but I'm also excited and ready to knock it out of the ballpark! Although I somewhat had the Kitchen mentality when applying to DBC, I felt that Shereef's Kitchen vs Table mentality was spot on. I could really relate to what he was saying and I totally agree that we should come in with the Kitchen mindset. </h4>
