              For years, I have wanted to work in the industry that I had trained for in college. This industry, Application Specific Integrated Chip(ASIC) Design, will always be fascinating as the heart of technology is always created in this line of work. I worked for an ASIC design services company and found it to be a marvelous ride filled with experiences that I'll never forget. However, I started wondering if this was my true calling.

            </p>
            <p>  
              The answers to these questions are important to me as I want to stay engaged and focused as well as having role models to follow. I began looking into programming and web development as it was something that I have always feared. After spending 19 intensive weeks at a coding bootcamp, I can say that I'm simultaneously comfortable and uncomfortable while being challenged on a daily basis. I'm motivated by seeing such a large community contributing to numerous projects all around the world. Mentorship and inspiration will be the main factors that will drive you year in and year out.

                  Hummingbird was created with a purpose of scheduling text messages so that they could be sent at the right time. Our idea was to have the backend API always up and running so that frontend users could connect to it. The best way to envision this idea was through decoupled architecture. By decoupling the web app, the backend could actively batch up messages to be sent while the frontend users access the application to schedule their messages. The tech stack includes Ruby on Rails using the Twilio API for the backend and Ionic(AngularJS) framework for the frontend.
