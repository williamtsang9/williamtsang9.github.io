    <h4 style="text-indent:40px"> Until I read the articles supplied by Dev Bootcamp, I had no idea that stereotype threats existed in such a large scale. I was always perceptive about stereotyping but generally try to steer clear of that zone. However, through time and experiences, I have learned that stereotyping is unescapable. There's always going to be someone mentioning the strong points of certain nationalities. For example, when I was in middle school and high school, people would consisently ask me for help in Math class. These individuals thought I was mathematically gifted because I was of Asian heritage. News Flash! My nationality does not dictate my intellectual knowledge! My success was due to hours of practice and understanding of theories found in books! That's only one example from my past. This also happens to people of all nationalities! 
    <br>
    I usually try to ignore stereotyping but I've started realizing that it's always going to be around. Why not try to make a difference and teach others with my knowledge? That way, any nationality can have skills that they are not stereotypically known to have.
