        <h3>What is a good question?</h3>
<p>
    <h4 style="text-indent:40px">In my opinion, a good question is a question where the individual is genuinely asking for help wherever he/she maybe stuck at. Say for instance, you've been working on this tough question but get stuck with the if else conditional statements. Try doing some research first to see if you can find an example remotely close to that problem. If you are still stuck, you may always contact a forum/community and present the problem. A few things to note are be aware of what you are asking and always be presentable even though no one can see you through your computer screen. It is also important to respond with respect as a little respect can go a long way! Submitting a genuine and well thoughtout question will surely get responses.
    <br></h4>
    <h4 style="text-indent:40px">Looking back at my questions, I feel that I have asked good questions to my fellow cohorts. However, when looking on Stack Overflow's forums, I find that there are people asking bad questions which are just incoherent and demand an answer without much care of understanding the problem. I believe this happens all too much so I've took in the responsibility to ask good and thoughtful questions whenever needed. 
    <br></h4>
    <h4 style="text-indent:40px">Here are a few characteristics of a good question.
    <ul>
      <li>Conception of the problem</li>
      <li>Purpose of the problem</li>
      <li>Any initial solution attempted</li>      
      <li>A specific explanation of where you are stuck</li>
      <li>Online etiquacy and respectfulness</li>
      <li>Grammar and punctuation</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="text-indent:40px">All these small things contribute to cultivating a good question. If the question is well thought out, a well thought out community will come to voice their advice and opinion. If a user just throws a random question out to the community expecting some sort of response/answer back, he/she will get the same type of response back from the community. Asking a good question takes practice but will benefit you in the long run. 
    <h4>Here's a powerful video that I came across a few months ago. When I started researching the topic, a good question, I thought of this video. It's a bit off topic since it's not about asking good questions but it certainly shows that <em><strong>changing your words</strong></em> will yield better responses. Please take a look!
