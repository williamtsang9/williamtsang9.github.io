        Here's my thinking chart. For the most part, I think I am an <strong>Abstract Random Thinker.</strong> However, <strong>Concrete Random Thinker and Concrete Sequential Thinker</strong> followed closely. Check my chart for a closer look!

          <li style="list-style-type:none;">
            Abstract Random: Organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. They work best when;
             <br>
              <br>            
              <li class="learningstyle">Work and share progress with others.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Assignments that reflect and require personalization.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Get personal attention and emotional support.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Have social activities to balance work.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Have open communication with others.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Have a noncompetitive atmosphere.</li>
              <br>
              <br>              
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:none;">
            Concrete Random: Tend to experiment and run tests. Self driven. They work best when;
              <br>            
              <br>
              <li class="learningstyle">Can try new approaches and solve problems.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Self-directed.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Competitive.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Create their own answers.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">asks themselves, "How many different ways can I do this?</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Use trial and error approaches.</li>   
              <br>
              <br>                          
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:none;">
            Concrete Sequential: Tend to analyze information in an ordered and linear thought process. They work best when;
              <br>            
              <br>              
              <li class="learningstyle">Have an orderly quiet environment.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Know the accepted way of doing things.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Have exact directions and examples.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Can be consistent and efficient.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Face limitded change in predictable situations.</li>
              <li class="learningstyle">Have a guided practice with an organized person.</li>                  
              <br>
              <br>              
          </li>          
        </h4>

        <h4 style="text-indent:40px">I feel that this chart is quite accurate as I do see the three sides of me as an abstract random thinker, concrete random thinker and a concrete sequential thinker. However, I think I am more likely the Concrete Random thinker because I love to do my own experiments. I usually prove myself through trial and error and will often try more ways than one to approach a difficult problem. This will definitely give me an edge in DBC and in the future as therea re many ways to do the same thing and yield the same answer. I will be able to come in with different perspectives and analyze the situation in a broader point of view.</h4>

        <h4 style="text-indent:40px">
            I think my experience with Unit 1 in Phase 0 has been <strong><em>SOLID.</em></strong> The biggest struggle for me was trying to get over my fears of leaving my previous job to pursue what I've wanted to do for years. It's scary because we're taking this leap of faith and commiting ourselves to the idea. I always thought I wouldn't be able to learn how to code just because it was out of my league but look at how far I've come now, I'm already coding HTML/CSS and parts of Ruby. All I needed was some motivation, material and most importantly my own commitment. 
        </h4>

        <h4 style="text-indent:40px">
          Throughout Phase 0 Unit 1, I realized that a growth mindset is definitely helpful and is different from a fixed mindset. I've been living with a fixed mindset all my life and I've tried to think with a growth mindset ever since starting DBC. It's only been 4 weeks but it has helped me with accepting my failures as learning experiences rather than beating myself up! Realize that there are multiple paths leading to the same mountain summit. I intend to keep my growth mindset and progress throughout DBC and my future.
